  "description": "HEVS (High-End Visualization System) is a Unity plugin that attempts to simplify the creation of cross-platform multi-modal visualization projects across various display mediums (hardware solutions), including within clustered display environments.\n\nHEVS supports various visualisation platforms, including PC, CAVE, XR, Multitouch Walls, Hemispherical Domes and other curved projection-based displays, such as cylinders, and includes warping & blending functionallity.\n\nAlthough it is impossible to automatically cover all platforms, the philosophy of HEVS is to make it as easy as possible to create a single application that can run in various environments, attempting to allow for a single executable to run on different display modalities without the need to re-build.",
